INTRODUCTION

This reflection document chronicles my transformative 13-week journey as a Data
Engineer at ACA Group during the "Sustainathon" project - a mission-critical initiative to
revolutionize Duvel Moortgat's sustainability reporting for CSRD compliance. From
February 24th to May 28th, 2025, I experienced not just technical growth, but a complete
transformation from student to professional consultant.

1.1

About ACA Group and the Datadots Team

ACA Group is a leading Belgian IT consulting firm with 253 employees, of which 152 are
IT professionals. I joined their "Datadots" team - a collaborative group of data engineers,
analysts, and consultants based across multiple offices in Hasselt, Antwerp, Leuven, and
Gent. The team culture was exceptional; everyone was ready to answer questions and
provide support, creating an environment where learning and growth flourished.

1.2

The Sustainathon Challenge

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is a European Union regulation
requiring companies to report detailed ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance)
information. For Duvel Moortgat, Belgium's premier brewery group with facilities across
multiple countries, this meant transforming their manual, spreadsheet-based
sustainability reporting into an automated, reliable system capable of handling complex
data from 20+ global sites.

1.3

Building on Foundation

What made this project particularly interesting was that it built upon a proof of concept
created the previous year by Kwinten Boes (now Project Manager/Data Analyst) and
Thibo Vanderkam (Data Engineer), both former ACA interns. I joined alongside fellow
intern Fabian Reyes, where Fabian focused on analysis and PowerBI dashboards while I
concentrated on data engineering and pipeline development. This structure taught me
the importance of specialization within collaborative teams.
This reflection explores both the technical achievements we delivered and my personal
evolution from uncertain student to confident data engineering professional.

PART 1: SUBSTANTIVE PROJECT REFLECTION

2.1

The Starting Reality: A Complex Data Ecosystem

When I first encountered Duvel Moortgat's sustainability reporting challenge, I was struck
by the sheer complexity. Data was scattered across dozens of Excel input sheets, multiple
ERP systems (Salesforce, Workday), production databases (SCADA, WinCC), energy
monitoring platforms, and manual input processes managed by stakeholders across the
globe. Our primary contact, Dries from Duvel's sustainability team, had been maintaining
this system through incredible manual effort - a process that was becoming unsustainable
as CSRD requirements evolved.
The existing proof of concept had demonstrated potential, but it required significant
engineering work to transform it from a working prototype into a production-ready
system that could handle Duvel's global operations reliably.

2.2

Technical Foundation: Learning While Building

2.2.1

Weeks 1-4: Mastering New Technologies

My journey began with intensive learning of technologies I'd never used: Microsoft Fabric
and dbt (data build tool). What struck me about Microsoft Fabric was that it's still actively
being developed - many features were in preview, and I learned to work with its quirks,
like how it doesn't override data by default, requiring me to manually remove and redownload Excel files in my scripts.
dbt, however, was a revelation. Coming from a background in Python and traditional SQL
scripting, dbt's approach to modular, testable, version-controlled data transformations
felt like a paradigm shift. The ability to write SQL that tells a story through documentation
and lineage was something I'd never experienced.
2.2.2

The Microsoft Fabric Ecosystem

Working with Fabric taught me about enterprise-grade data platforms. I learned to
implement the medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) that ACA uses as their
standard. Bronze for raw data, Silver for cleaned and enriched data, and Gold for
business-ready analytics. This wasn't just a technical pattern - it was a way of thinking
about data quality and governance that shaped my entire approach to the project.

7

2.3

Major Technical Breakthroughs

2.3.1

The Location Code Revolution (Week 8)

My first major confidence breakthrough came when I solved the location code assignment
problem. Previously, each input sheet had to be loaded individually with hardcoded
location mappings scattered throughout the transformation code. I created a dynamic
system that automatically grabs location codes from a central reference sheet and
assigns them to data rows during integration.
The impact was immediate: I transformed the water data loading process from over 300
lines of repetitive code to just 80 lines using Jinja templating in dbt - and this was just
one model among many that benefited from this approach. More importantly, I created
a system where adding a new Duvel facility required changes in only 2 places instead of
20+ locations throughout the codebase.
2.3.2

Dynamic Currency Conversion (Week 9)

Building on this success, I developed a year-based currency conversion system that
automatically processes conversion rates for any year from 2022 to the previous year.
The system dynamically generates queries for all available years, but importantly, Duvel
still needs to manually add the new year's conversion rates to their reference sheet before
year-end.
This system automatically processes whatever historical conversion rates are available in
the input sheet, but requires Duvel to manually update the conversion rates annually.
The innovation was making the processing dynamic - instead of hardcoding years 2022,
2023, 2024, the system automatically adapts to whatever years are present in the data,
reducing maintenance overhead while still requiring annual rate updates.

8

2.4

The ClimateCamp Integration Challenge

2.4.1

Weeks 8-10: Meeting External System Requirements

One of the most complex aspects of the project was integrating with ClimateCamp,
Duvel's sustainability calculation platform. ClimateCamp required data in extremely
specific formats for environmental impact calculations. Every data point needed precise
categorization, validation, and formatting according to complex environmental
accounting standards.
This challenge taught me that data engineering isn't just about moving data between
systems - it's about understanding the business logic and regulatory requirements that
govern how that data must be structured. Working with ClimateCamp forced me to think
like a sustainability analyst while engineering like a developer.

2.5

Architecture and Code Quality Revolution

2.5.1

Week 10-11: The Great Refactoring

Perhaps my most significant technical achievement was restructuring the entire data
pipeline to implement a proper medallion architecture. This wasn't just about
reorganizing code - it was about establishing data quality patterns that would scale with
Duvel's growing sustainability reporting needs.
I eliminated 253 lines of hardcoded elements from a single dbt model alone, replacing
them with dynamic, parameterized solutions. Since this pattern was applied across
multiple models throughout the project, the total code reduction was substantial. The
result was a system that was not only more maintainable but also more reliable. Adding
new locations went from a 20-step process prone to human error to a simple 2-step
configuration change.
2.5.2

Performance and Efficiency Gains

The architectural improvements delivered measurable results:
•
•
•
•
•

Reduction in Microsoft Fabric Compute Unit (CU) usage
Faster data integrations trough optimizations in the integration notebook
Faster data transformations through optimized query patterns
Reduced maintenance overhead through parameterized pipelines
Enhanced error detection and monitoring capabilities

2.6

Business Impact and Production Deployment

2.6.1

What We Delivered

By the end of 13 weeks, we had transformed Duvel Moortgat's sustainability reporting
from a manual, error-prone process into an automated, scalable system:
•
•
•
•
•
2.6.2

41 completed project tasks covering all major sustainability reporting
requirements
Data integration from 15+ sources including production systems, HR platforms,
and external APIs
Automated ClimateCamp integration reducing manual data preparation from days
to hours
Comprehensive monitoring system with real-time alerts for data quality issues
Test/production environments enabling safe development and deployment cycles
Current Operational Status

The system is now in production and actively used by Duvel's sustainability team for
CSRD compliance reporting. Our dashboard processes data from facilities across Belgium,
Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, China and the
United States, providing real-time visibility into sustainability metrics that previously
required weeks of manual compilation.
2.6.3

Recommendations for Future Development

Based on our implementation experience, I recommend several next steps:
•
•
•

API Integration Expansion: Prioritize the Fluvius API integration for real-time
energy data, eliminating the last major manual input requirement
Enhanced Data Validation: Implement additional automated quality checks to
further reduce manual oversight needs
User Training Program: Develop structured training to ensure stakeholders can
maximize the system's capabilities

PART 2: PERSONAL REFLECTION

3.1

Professional Identity Formation

When I started this internship, I thought data engineering was primarily about writing
SQL queries and building ETL pipelines. I discovered it's actually about solving business
problems, managing complexity across organizational boundaries, and building systems
that people can trust with critical decisions.
3.1.1

From Student to Consultant

The transition from academic projects to professional consulting was profound. In
university, requirements are clearly defined and success is measured by grades. In
consulting, requirements evolve constantly, stakeholders have competing priorities, and
success is measured by business value and client satisfaction.
The ability to work closely together with Thibo, my primary mentor, was instrumental in
this transformation. Rather than just teaching me technical skills, Thibo helped me
understand the consulting mindset: always consider the business context, communicate
clearly about risks and trade-offs, and build relationships alongside technical solutions.

3.2

Technical Growth Beyond Tools

3.2.1

Microsoft Fabric Mastery

Learning Microsoft Fabric taught me more than just another platform - it taught me how
to work with bleeding-edge technology in production environments. Since Fabric is still
actively being developed with many features in preview, I learned to adapt to platform
limitations, work around quirks, and build robust solutions despite technological
uncertainty.
3.2.2

The Power of dbt

dbt fundamentally changed how I think about data transformation. The combination of
SQL, version control, testing, and documentation created a development experience that
felt both powerful and maintainable. More importantly, dbt's emphasis on clear naming
and documentation taught me that code should tell a story that future maintainers can
follow.
3.2.3

Security and Enterprise Thinking

Moving credentials from hardcoded values to Azure KeyVault wasn't just a security
improvement - it taught me that professional development requires thinking about
operations, maintenance, and security from day one. This experience made me
appreciate that secure, maintainable systems require additional complexity, but that
complexity pays dividends in reliability and peace of mind.

11

3.3

Problem-Solving Evolution

3.3.1

Early Uncertainty to Systematic Confidence

My approach to complex problems evolved dramatically over the 13 weeks. Initially, when
faced with issues in weeks 2-3, I tried to solve everything myself, spending hours
debugging configuration files. I learned that in professional environments, knowing when
to ask for help and how to communicate problems clearly is just as important as technical
troubleshooting skills.
By the time I encountered the ClimateCamp integration challenge in weeks 8-10, I had
developed a systematic approach: break complex problems into components, research
the business context, design step-by-step solutions, and communicate progress clearly
to stakeholders.
3.3.2

The Data Quality Mindset

Working with Duvel's input sheets taught me that data engineering is as much about
human psychology as it is about technology. People move entire data tables three rows
down for no apparent reason, leave rows half-filled, hide problematic data instead of
fixing it, and add comments in unexpected places.
Learning to anticipate and handle these human factors taught me that robust data
systems must be designed for human unpredictability. The monitoring and validation
systems I built weren't just technical solutions - they were responses to the reality of
how people interact with data in high-pressure environments.

3.4

Communication and Stakeholder Management

3.4.1

Learning Multiple Languages

One of my most significant growth areas was learning to communicate the same technical
concept to different audiences. For example, when explaining our location code solution:
•
•
•

To Thibo (Technical Mentor): "I implemented dynamic location mapping using
Jinja macros in dbt, which eliminated hardcoded location references and reduced
the codebase by 253 lines."
To Dries (Sustainability Manager): "We automated the process of linking data to
facility locations, so adding a new site now takes 5 minutes instead of 2 hours and
eliminates the risk of mapping errors."
To End Users: "The system now automatically knows which data belongs to which
brewery, so you don't need to worry about manually tagging everything."

This experience taught me that technical expertise without communication skills severely
limits your impact as a consultant.

12

3.5

Personal Insights and Growth

3.5.1

Discovering My Professional Strengths

This internship helped me identify what energizes me professionally. I discovered that I
thrive at the intersection of technical complexity and business impact. Building elegant
technical solutions is satisfying, but seeing how those solutions enable better decisionmaking and regulatory compliance is what truly motivates me.
3.5.2

The Value of Collaborative Expertise

Working with Fabian taught me the power of complementary skills. While I focused on
data engineering and pipeline development, Fabian managed client communication and
dashboard development. This specialization allowed us to deliver higher quality work than
either of us could have achieved alone.
3.5.3

Building Confidence Through Contribution

Perhaps the most significant personal growth was developing genuine confidence in my
ability to contribute meaningfully to complex professional projects. Starting as someone
who had never used the primary technologies, and ending as someone who could
implement effective solutions and explain these technologies to others, was profoundly
empowering.

3.6

Technical Passion Project: The Home Lab

3.6.1

Open Source Alternative Development

In my free time, I built a complete open-source alternative to Microsoft Fabric on my
home server. Using Jupyter notebooks, Airflow, MinIO, PostgreSQL, dbt, and Superset, I
recreated our entire data pipeline architecture at smaller scale. This wasn't just a
technical exercise - it reflected my deep interest in privacy, security, and understanding
technology at a fundamental level.
The home lab project taught me that the tools matter less than understanding the
underlying patterns. Whether using Microsoft's enterprise stack or assembling opensource components, the core challenges of data quality, pipeline reliability, and user
experience remain the same.

13

3.7

Career Clarity and Future Direction

3.7.1

The Cybersecurity Pivot

While this internship confirmed my passion for data engineering, it also reminded me of
my broader interests across technology fields. My decision to pursue a master's degree
in cybersecurity abroad represents my curiosity and passion for exploring different areas
of technology - whether that's AI, programming, data engineering, or cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity has always been one of my interests alongside data engineering, not
necessarily as a combination but as separate fields that both fascinate me. The internship
experience gave me confidence that I can adapt to and excel in different technology
domains, making me excited to explore cybersecurity as its own field of study.
3.7.2

Long-term Professional Vision

This internship taught me that I can thrive in different technology domains and that I'm
genuinely excited by multiple fields - data engineering, AI, cybersecurity, and
programming. Whether I continue in data engineering, pursue cybersecurity
specialization, or explore other technology areas, the foundation of problem-solving,
stakeholder communication, and professional growth I built during this internship will be
invaluable.
The experience showed me that technical skills transfer across domains, but more
importantly, that the ability to learn, adapt, and deliver business value is what matters
most in any technology career.

CONCLUSION

My internship at ACA Group's Sustainathon project was far more than a capstone to my
academic program - it was a complete transformation from student to professional, from
individual contributor to collaborative team member, and from someone who writes code
to someone who solves business problems using technology.
The technical achievements were substantial: we delivered a production-ready
sustainability reporting platform that processes data from 15+ sources across multiple
countries, automates complex regulatory calculations, and provides real-time visibility
into Duvel Moortgat's environmental impact. But the personal growth was even more
valuable.
I developed not just technical skills, but professional competencies: the ability to
communicate complex ideas clearly, manage stakeholder relationships effectively, and
deliver business value under uncertainty. Working with experienced professionals like
Thibo and Kwinten, collaborating with talented peers like Fabian, and contributing to a
meaningful project with real regulatory and business impact provided a foundation that
could never be gained through academic study alone.

4.1

Looking Forward

As I transition to studying cybersecurity, I carry with me not just technical knowledge
and project experience, but a deeper understanding of what it means to be a professional
who can bridge the gap between complex technology and business value. The problems
I learned to solve at ACA - data quality, system reliability, stakeholder communication,
and value delivery under pressure - are universal challenges in technology consulting.
This internship didn't just prepare me for my career - it launched it. The confidence,
skills, and professional network I built during these 13 weeks have fundamentally
changed my trajectory and capabilities as a technology professional.

4.2

Final Reflection

The most rewarding aspect of this experience was seeing our technical work translate
directly into business value. Duvel Moortgat now has a system that not only meets their
CSRD compliance requirements but provides the foundation for data-driven sustainability
decisions. Knowing that our engineering work contributes to environmental accountability
and transparency makes every line of code and every solved problem feel meaningful.
This internship confirmed that technology work is most fulfilling when it serves a purpose
larger than the technology itself. As I continue my career, I will seek opportunities to
apply technical skills to challenges that matter - whether in cybersecurity, data
engineering, or the intersection of both.

This reflection represents my honest assessment of both the technical
project we delivered and the personal growth I experienced during my
internship at ACA Group. The challenges were real, the learning was
intense, and the impact - both on Duvel Moortgat's operations and on
my professional development - was transformative.
