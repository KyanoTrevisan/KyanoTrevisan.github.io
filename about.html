                    <h2>Personal</h2>
                    <p>I am an advocate for online privacy and security, believing that safeguarding individual
                        anonymity is crucial in the digital world.</p>
                    <p>In addition to privacy, I have a keen interest in open-source intelligence (OSINT) and
                        operational security (OpSec). OSINT refers to the process of collecting and analyzing publicly
                        available information from various sources, such as social media, websites, and public records.
                        This practice is essential for understanding potential threats and vulnerabilities in the
                        digital landscape, and it empowers individuals and organizations to make informed decisions
                        about their security posture.</p>
                    <p>Operational security (OpSec) involves the processes and practices that protect sensitive
                        information from being accessed by adversaries. It encompasses identifying critical information,
                        analyzing threats, and implementing measures to mitigate risks. By understanding and applying
                        OpSec principles, individuals can better safeguard their personal data and maintain their
                        privacy in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
                    <p>Cryptography fascinates me, as it forms the backbone of secure communication and data protection.
                        I enjoy exploring various cryptographic methods and their applications in enhancing privacy.</p>
                    <p>I run a comprehensive self-hosting infrastructure on enterprise-grade hardware (HP ProLiant DL380 Gen9 with 48 CPU cores and 756GB RAM). This setup hosts numerous privacy-focused services including Matrix homeserver, Nextcloud, Jellyfin, and various development tools.</p>
                    <p>As a proponent of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), I make everything I code open source. I
                        believe in the power of community collaboration and transparency in software development, and I
                        strive to contribute to projects that align with these values.</p>
