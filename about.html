		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
			Hello, it is a pleasure to meet you. I am a 20-year-old applied computer science student currently studying
			at
			Thomas More Hogeschool in Geel, and I live in Beringen.</p>
		<p>
			As a computer science student, I have a keen interest in technology. The field of technology is
			constantly evolving and I find it fascinating to keep up with the latest developments and innovations. This
			interest has allowed me to explore and learn about various aspects of technology, from software to hardware.
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, I enjoy baking in my spare time. It is a fulfilling hobby that allows me to exercise my
			creativity and precision while producing delicious treats. I find the process of following recipes and
			combining
			ingredients to produce a beautiful and tasty outcome truly enjoyable.</p>
