          <h2>4.0: Weed detection system</h2>
          <img src="images/4-0-ai-visualization.png" alt="big data image classifier">
          <p>
            Due to a Non-disclosure Agreement, I am unable to provide more images of the application. However, I have
            created a visualization to help you understand my part of the project. The client wanted to receive a
            heatmap showing
            where certain weeds are present in farm fields. The fields with too many of these weeds are not allowed to
            be used
            by the farmer. The process was as follows: we received drone images from the farm fields in (GEO)TIF format,
            and
            from the (GEO)TIF images, we could get the coordinates of the top-left corner of where the image was taken.
            The
            images were then converted to PNG format, and my AI model (YOLOv8) performed detection on the PNG images,
            drawing
            boxes around the
            weeds and saving the pixel coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the detections. I then
            calculated
            the center of the detections and converted the pixel coordinates to geographical coordinates. Finally, I
            created a GeoJSON
            file that could be used by my teammates to create the heatmap.

          <h2>Big Data: Image Classifier</h2>
          <img src="images/big_data.png" alt="big data image classifier">
          <p>
            For this project, we trained an image classifier that predicts between big cats (jaguars, lions, snow
            leopards, and
            tigers). To train our AI model, we first built a web scraper, which we used to scrape images from Google to
            build a
            dataset. We then used this dataset to build our AI model, and used Streamlit to turn it into a web app. The
            web
            application allows you to upload an image of either of these big cats, and it will output a predicted class
            and the
            probability. We trained this model to try and beat Google's "Teachable Machine," in which we succeeded.
