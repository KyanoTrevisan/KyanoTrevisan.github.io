                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>I spent 13 weeks at ACA Group working on the "Sustainathon 2025" project, helping Duvel Moortgat build a system for CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) compliance. The project took what was a working proof-of-concept and transformed it into a production-ready platform that could actually scale and maintain itself.</p>

                    <p>The bulk of my work involved optimizing and restructuring the code and data architecture. Instead of manually writing out the same code pattern for every location and data type, I introduced dynamic Jinja templating that loops through locations and applies the right suffixes. This pattern was repeated across many models, cutting hundreds of lines of repetitive code. I also reduced processing time across the entire pipeline, and simplified the data model while improving error handling. Those improvements added up to something that was more maintainable.</p>

                <div class="project-overview">
                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Duvel Moortgat is a major brewery group operating across multiple countries. Like many companies, they needed to meet the CSRD regulations, which is a European directive requiring companies to report on their sustainability impact. This meant collecting data on environmental impact, social aspects, and governance metrics from dozens of facilities, all tracked with audit trails and documentation.</p>

                    <p>The groundwork had already been laid. Kwinten Boes (Project Manager) and Thibo Vanderkam (Data Engineer, my tech lead) had built a proof of concept the year before. They did solid work on it, but their internship was disrupted when the client got hacked, which set them back significantly. Because of the time crunch, the codebase worked fine but was messy in places.</p>

                    <p>I worked alongside Fabian Reyes, another intern who was a data analyst. His role was to take the data I prepared in the gold layer and use it to build reports and dashboards for the client. My focus was on making sure the data pipeline was clean, maintainable, and actually scalable. Thibo was my tech lead throughout, helping me navigate decisions and the codebase we inherited.</p>

                            <p>What was a manual, error-prone process became an automated system that collects and processes data from over 20 facilities across 8 countries. They don't have to manually compile reports anymore.</p>

                            <p>Adding new facilities is now straightforward. Thanks to the Jinja loops, you only update a couple of configuration places instead of adding code to every single model. We also extract location codes dynamically from the Excel files, so we don't have to hardcode them like before. The system can adapt as new facilities come online or regulations change.</p>

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>This internship was more than just learning tools. It was a shift in how I approach problems. I went from being a student solving academic exercises to working on something real that would be used in production. That difference matters.</p>

                    <p>On the technical side, I got hands-on experience with Microsoft Fabric and dbt in a production environment, not just in tutorials. I learned how to think about data architecture, error handling, and testing in ways that matter when code affects real business operations.</p>

                    <p>But the bigger learning was about the human side of engineering. I had to communicate technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders, debug issues in unfamiliar codebases, and think about how to make systems that other people would actually want to use and maintain. I also learned that working with enterprise tools like Azure KeyVault and managing production environments is different. You need to be more careful, more thoughtful, and more deliberate.</p>

                <div class="reflection">
                    <h2>The Most Important Lesson</h2>
                    <p>Data engineering isn't just about writing clean code or optimizing queries. It's about understanding how humans interact with data. During this project, I realized that people will move entire data tables by hand, leave rows half-filled, and add comments in unexpected places. They will do things that don't make sense from an engineering perspective (but make perfect sense from theirs).</p>

                    <p>The systems that work are the ones designed for human reality, not human ideals. That's why the improvements we made (the simplified configuration, the error handling, the audit trails) mattered. They weren't just technical improvements. They made the system something people could actually use without breaking it.</p>

                    <p>And that's what good engineering is about: making systems that help people do their jobs better, even when people don't always do what the system designers expected.</p>
